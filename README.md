Conference website 

NUST is flourishing in scientific research and innovative solutions in a world that is
fast-changing. In line with this endeavor, you are assigned into the technical committee organising an upcoming International Conference on Technologies for Humanity.
As such, you thought of developing a website to smoothen the background processes.

The website should give general information about the conference. Such information
include, but not limited to:
• Conference Objective: to discuss practical and innovative technological
solutions to everyday challenges that human face.
• Call for papers and posters: deadlines, author guidelines, topics, etc.
• Other details: conference venue, technical committee details, invited speakers,

On the website, users should be able to register themselves.

addition to this, below are descriptions of the operations that are carried out by the
two categories of users:
• Researcher: Upload papers, see reviews of his/her papers from other researchers,
anonymously review papers by other researchers by rating on a five star and
giving feedback comments, etc.
